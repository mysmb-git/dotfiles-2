# This file executes as a bash script, which turns around and executes Ruby via

# the second "!ruby" shebang. This allows us to work on Linux, where the
# shebang can only have one argument so we can't directly say
# "#!/usr/bin/env ruby --disable-gems". Thanks for that, Linux.
#
# If this seems confusing, don't worry. You can treat it as a normal Ruby file
# starting with the "!ruby" shebang below.
